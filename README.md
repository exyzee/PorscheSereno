- **Real-Time Driving Simulator:** Simulate driving conditions, speed, and traffic in a realistic dashboard.
- **Traffic Condition Monitoring:** Instantly see traffic status and get smart route suggestions.
- **Breathing Exercise Widget:** Take a calming breath right from your dashboard when traffic gets stressful.
